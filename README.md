### Hi there 👋

I'm Geoff Hutchison
- I'm an Associate Professor at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/)
  - In the Department of Chemistry
  - Also in the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering

Our lab webpage: https://hutchisonlab.org/

We develop new materials, as well as functional microscale and nanoscale devices. 
We focus on building electronic materials from molecular subunits, both organic and inorganic, using a variety of techniques to rationally design the desired properties. 
This encompasses chemical synthesis, characterization (both physical and chemical), combined with theoretical modeling and simulation.

- ⚗️ Designer, co-creator, and lead developer of [Avogadro](https://avogadro.cc/)
