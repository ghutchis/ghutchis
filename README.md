### Hi there üëã

I'm Geoff Hutchison
- I'm a Professor at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/)
  - In the Department of Chemistry
  - Also in the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering

Our lab webpage: https://hutchisonlab.org/

We develop new materials, as well as functional microscale and nanoscale devices. 
We focus on building electronic materials from molecular subunits, both organic and inorganic, using a variety of techniques to rationally design the desired properties. 
This encompasses chemical synthesis, characterization (both physical and chemical), combined with theoretical modeling and simulation.

On GitHub, we publish raw science (Open Science), scripts, and chemistry tools
